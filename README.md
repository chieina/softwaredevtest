TVPage Developer Test
=====================

Develop a web app that given an url, will give insight to what domains that web page is linking. In addition to the start url a link depth can be specified. In that case all pages within link depth distance should be part of the analysis.

Requirements:
-------------
Use a (probably) free cloud platform to host the app or run locally and send instructions on how to run.

### As a minimum the result should:

- list all domains
- per domain have a drop down with the list of url in that domain.
- some graphic charts, for example a histogram.
- a responsive design: background processing while having a functional web page.
- Or request can be queued; submitting a query while investigating a previous result.

### Additional features:
Add a mechanism to identify returning users and show them a history of searches.

### To be delivered:
- Fair estimation of the number of hours spent.
- The url to a working web site.
- All code behind it, both static and dynamic contents, in a comprehensible
 way.

Short document describing:
- Functionality with pointers to the code; document should introduce code base, not replicate what can be read in the code itself.
- Status of work
- Whatâ€™s finished
- Todos
- Suggestions for improvements
- Additional deliverable:
 -- Suggestions how to test the web site
 -- Unit tests for the code
